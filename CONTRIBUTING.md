## Translation

The translation of Pika Backup is managed by the [GNOME Translation Project](https://wiki.gnome.org/TranslationProject) and the respective [language teams](https://l10n.gnome.org/teams/). The translation status is available on the [module page](https://l10n.gnome.org/module/pika-backup/).

## Nightly Builds

When reporting bugs or feature requests, you can try out the [nightly build](https://welcome.gnome.org/app/PikaBackup/#installing-a-nightly-build) first to see if your issue has already been resolved.

## Debugging

The log level can be adjusted by setting the `G_MESSAGES_DEBUG` to `all`. For example

```sh
$ G_MESSAGES_PREFIXED="" G_MESSAGES_DEBUG=all cargo run
```

Currently, `pika-backup` and `pika-backup-trace` are used as logging domains. You can use `G_MESSAGES_DEBUG=pika-backup` to get debug, but no trace output.

See ["Running GLib Applications"](https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/glib-running.html) for more options.

## Peculiarities

### Help format

The help pages are currently written in [ducktype](http://projectmallard.org/ducktype/1.0/index.html). The files are stored in `help/C/duck` and the corresponding `.page`-files can be generated via `make -C help/C/`. Afterwards, you can preview the generated help pages via `yelp help/C/index.page`. The generated `.page`-files have to be committed to the repository as well. The `ducktype` program required for running `make` is probably packaged in you distro and is also [availabe on GitHub](https://github.com/projectmallard/mallard-ducktype).

### Flatpak manifests

The `org.gnome.World.PikaBackup.Devel.json` manifest is generated via `generate-manifest.sh`. Please adjust the `org.gnome.World.PikaBackup.yml` manifest and generate the devel version from it.

## Use of Generative AI

This project does not allow contributions generated by large languages models (LLMs) and chatbots. This ban includes, but is not limited to, tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, DeepSeek, and Devin AI. We are taking these steps as precaution due to the potential negative influence of AI generated content on quality, as well as likely copyright violations.

This ban of AI generated content applies to all parts of the projects, including, but not limited to, code, documentation, issues, and artworks. An exception applies for purely translating texts for issues and comments to English.

AI tools can be used to answer questions and find information. However, we encourage contributors to avoid them in favor of using [existing documentation](https://developer.gnome.org) and our [chats and forums](https://welcome.gnome.org). Since AI generated information is frequently misleading or false, we cannot supply support on anything referencing AI output.
