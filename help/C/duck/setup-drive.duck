* Ensure the $gui(Repository Folder) has your removable drive selected. If not, press the $gui[.button](Repository Folder) button
* The new backup $link[>general-glossary#repository](repository) will be created in a folder with the specified $gui(Repository Name).
* Press $gui[.button](Continue)
* Choose the desired $link[>general-glossary#encryption](encryption) settings
